# Galaxy Flavor Testing

Galaxy Flavors are the easiest way to get production ready, specifically tailored tool collections in the hand of users.
To read more about it by visiting the [Galaxy website](http://galaxyproject.org/) and the [Galaxy Docker project](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable).

This projects hosts Travis scripts to unify and ease the testing of such flavors. Copy the included [`example_travis.yml`](example_travis.yml) into your github repository of your Galaxy flavor, name it `.travis.yml` and it will be tested automatically.

Note: You need to activate Travis as described [here.](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started)
